Hi my name is Alanna Mottesheard,

I'm interested in automated data collection and configuration to reduce collection overhead. I am also
interested in performance optimizations gained by leveraging object oriented tools and low level solutions.

I'm currently learning the basics of web development and creating a full stack product for my Master's project.
Soon I'll be graduating from Florida State University and joining NVIDIA's TensorRT Safety team.

I'm not looking for new projects at the moment, but I would like to work on data collection automation optimizations
in the future.
